Description: ===============================================================
        sqlitedict -- persistent `dict`, backed-up by SQLite and pickle
        ===============================================================
        
        A lightweight wrapper around Python's sqlite3 database, with a dict-like interface
        and multi-thread access support::
        
        >>> mydict = SqliteDict('some.db', autocommit=True) # the mapping will be persisted to file `some.db`
        >>> mydict['some_key'] = any_picklable_object
        >>> print mydict['some_key']
        >>> print len(mydict) # etc... all dict functions work
        
        Pickle is used internally to serialize the values. Keys are strings.
        
        If you don't use autocommit (default is no autocommit for performance), then
        don't forget to call `mydict.commit()` when done with a transaction.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * Values can be **any picklable objects** (uses `cPickle` with the highest protocol).
        * Support for **multiple tables** (=dicts) living in the same database file.
        * Support for **access from multiple threads** to the same connection (needed by e.g. Pyro).
          Vanilla sqlite3 gives you `ProgrammingError: SQLite objects created in a thread can
          only be used in that same thread.`
        
        Concurrent requests are still serialized internally, so this "multithreaded support"
        **doesn't** give you any performance benefits. It is a work-around for sqlite limitations in Python.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The module has no dependencies beyond 2.5 <= Python < 3.0. Install or upgrade with::
        
            sudo easy_install -U sqlitedict
        
        or from the `source tar.gz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sqlitedict>`_ ::
        
            python sqlitedict.py # run some tests
            sudo python setup.py install
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Standard Python document strings are inside the module::
        
        >>> import sqlitedict
        >>> help(sqlitedict)
        
        (but it's just `dict` with a commit, really).
