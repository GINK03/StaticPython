Limitations
*************

This page used to list bugs in Cython that made the semantics of
compiled code differ from that in Python.  Most of the missing
features have been fixed in Cython 0.15.  The bug tracker has an
up-to-date `list of remaining compatibility issues`_.  Note that a
future version 1.0 of Cython is planned to provide full Python
language compatibility.
